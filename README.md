Linq.js is a tool for querying over lists of JSON objects, designed by Microsoft .NET Framework's [LINQ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/bb397926.aspx), rewriten for Javascript, and as powerful for manipulating arrays of JSON objetcs, like querying, filtering, selecting, ordering and many other functions, adding over 90 different functions.
